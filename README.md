# Polynomial_ADT
This is a java program for carrying out arthimatic operations on polynomials. The program makes use of linked lists for managing the segments of the polynomials as well automaticaly displaying the answer in a corect foramt.

Last of all I tried to tune the program to read many different input formats and wrong unput formats to prevent crashes.
